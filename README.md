# Headless Chrome

  Starting with Chrome 57, we can run Chrome as a **headless browser**. It is a way to run the Chrome browser in a headless       environment without the full browser UI.
  
  ## Pros
    
    * Tests script will be executed in the same environment as users of your site
    * Headless Chrome gives you a real browser context without the memory overhead of running a full version of Chrome.
    * Chrome is faster and more stable than PhantomJS. And it doesnâ€™t eat memory like crazy
    
  ## Cons
  
    * If you need to do lots of debugging, headless debugging can be difficult.
    * You need to mimic real users
    
  ## Prerequisites
    
    * Google Chrome > 59
    * Chromedriver
    * Selenium
